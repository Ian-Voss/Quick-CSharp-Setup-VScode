The purpose of this short script is to allow the user to quickly set up a C# project for VScode, complete with a solution file, and folders for the main project and for classes.

The script asks for input to the user. It asks for a directory in which a container folder will be created. That folder will contain another two folders, one for the main C# script and one for classes. The solution file (.sln) is also contained in that folder.
