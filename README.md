# Quick-CSharp-Setup-VScode
The purpose of this short script is to allow the user to quickly set up a C# project for VScode, complete with a solution file, and folders for the main project and for classes.

The script asks for input to the user. It asks for a directory in which a container folder will be created. That folder will contain another two folders, one for the main C# script and one for classes. The solution file (.sln) is also contained in that folder. References are added.

This is primarily meant for people who wish to use C# with Visual Studio Code and not Visual Studio. Of course, this code is not REALLY exclusive to VScode, only the last line of the script, which opens the app.

You will see the instructions once you run the script.

Requisites:

  .The user must have Python 3 installed.
  
  .The user must have VScode installed. (Not really)
  
  .The user must have .NET installed.
  
  .Windows only.
  
To run the script, open your cmd. then go to the directory where the script is located using CD. then type python "C# maker.py".

Do let me know if you have any suggestions!
